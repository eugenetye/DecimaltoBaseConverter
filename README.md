# Decimal to Base Converter
This is a C program that converts a number from decimal to different bases.

## Project Specifications

This program takes **1)** a number written in decimal and **2)** the base that you want to convert to as *command line arguments* and output the answer. 
All bases from 2 to 36 should be able to be handled by this program. Error messages such as INVALID BASE or INVALID VALUE should be printed out if the input contains an invalid base (less than 2 or more than 36) or an invalid number of command line arguments.
